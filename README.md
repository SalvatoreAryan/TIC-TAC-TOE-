# TIC-TAC-TOE-
Simple GUI: The game uses the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface.

Two-Player Gameplay: It's designed for two players (X and O) who take turns on the same machine.

Score Tracking: The game keeps a running tally of wins for Player 1 (X), Player 2 (O), and ties.

Dynamic Board: The board automatically resets after each game, allowing players to start a new round without restarting the application.

Win and Tie Detection: The code includes logic to detect all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals) and to check for a tie when all squares are filled.
